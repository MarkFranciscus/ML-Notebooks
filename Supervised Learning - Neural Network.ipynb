    "\n",
    "The brain is a bunch of interconnected neurons that take some input signal (sound, light, touch, etc.) and passes it through a bunch of neurons, until it produces some output (thought, words, actions, etc).\n",

    "There's only really 3 parts of the neuron that we care about. The dendrites, cell body and the axon terminals. \n",
    "\n",
    "Dendrites - The input, this part of the cells takes input signals, each source of input has different sensitivities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cell body - The cell body processes the input signals, depending on the specific sensitivities, if the signal is strong enough the cell decides to \"fire\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Axon Terminals - Once the cell fires, the signal travels to the axon terminals which then pass on the signal to another cell's dendrites\n",
